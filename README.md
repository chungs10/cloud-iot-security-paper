This research presents a security analysis and defense framework for Cloud-IoT infrastructure, focusing on architectural vulnerabilities in interconnected cloud and edge environments.

##  Research Focus

* **Architectural Threat Modeling:** A layer-by-layer analysis of vulnerabilities from physical sensors to cloud applications.
* **Trust Management Framework:** A behavioral-scoring model to isolate malicious devices and ensure data integrity.
* **Multi-Cloud Governance Challenges:** Identified key risks in data privacy, CSP trust, and compliance in distributed environments.
* **Edge-Fog Security Paradigm:** Proposed using edge nodes for filtering and fog servers for encryption as a new security boundary.

##  Documents

* **[One-Page Summary](Chung_Cloud-IoT-Security_One-Pager.pdf)** - An overview of the security approach and mitigation strategies for Cloud-IoT systems.
* **Full Paper** - Available upon request | Contains the detailed threat models, defense methodologies, and peer-reviewed literature analysis.
